KOTOR 1 WideScreen Resolution Cutscene Patch



This repository is for building a script that will fix the swkotor.exe file once the KotOR 1 Remastered (AI Upscaled) Cutscenes mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1306) is installed. 
You can build these cutscenes yourself by following this guide (https://deadlystream.com/topic/4631-how-to-force-kotor-i-iis-bik-movies-to-play-in-any-resolution/) if you have a resolution not listed in the nexusmod page above, or it would be faster for you to render the videos yourself.

For some people the the Universal Widescreen Patcher doesn't seem to fully edit the exe hex values, and blah blah blha, but it's a non-trivial process to fix this mod if you have issues, so I decided to just write a script to do this automatically. 
This script should patch your exe file to run this mod without any issues. 
Make sure that you have the modifiable exe (https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1320-kotor-editable-executable/) which you should have used when patching the game using UniWS. 
[Not sure how you planned to run this mod without running the UniWS, but maybe you wanted to play the game in 800x600 and wanted the cutscenes in 4K *shrug*.]

Once you have done so, you can run this exe and patch your "swkotor.exe" file. 
I'd recommended copying your "swkotor.exe' file to a new directory for posterity, but you can just run it on your game directory directly if you're feeling devious. 
It should make a backup of your file anyways. 
It will ask you the path to your "swkotor.exe" file then the resolution you want the cutscenes in. 
Make sure it is the same resolution that you have installed the mod in, otherwise there's really no point in patching this is there? 
The exe will do its thing, and create a backup just in case something wonky happens (idk maybe your power goes out in the middle of it). 

Thanks to naelavok for upscaling these cutscenes, the KOTOR mod community, and Vasilii Zaytsev for figuring out the hex codes, and everyone else I failed to mention.

As always use at your own risk and don't blame me for an wonkiness.
